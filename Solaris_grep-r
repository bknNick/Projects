#Solaris has no grep -r option, so I wrote myself one. 
#Prompts for pattern and path then searches for that pattern in every file within the path (grep -r...).
#If anybody ever sees this and could use such a thing, here ya go (it's a one liner):

read -p "Enter the pattern youre looking for (CASE SENSITIVE) : " pattern && read -p "Enter the path in where to search: " SearchPath && tempfile="./grep-r"; trap "rm -rf $tempfile" INT;  for file in $(find $SearchPath -type f 2>/dev/null); do if grep $pattern $file >/dev/null; then echo $file >> $tempfile; fi; done && for entry in $(cat $tempfile); do echo "" && echo $entry && echo "" && grep $pattern $entry; done && rm $tempfile
